# SmartLock
Android smart lock-screen application

SmartLock is a Profile application used to help keep your phone secure without getting in your way. The default Android lockscreens take so long to unlock that 75% of users disable their lock screen all together, leaving their device vulnerable.

The aim of SmartLock is to only secure your device when there's risk of theft, allowing for instant access when in safe locations. All this is achieved automatically after an initial setup.

There's even some extra features to help you out, including changing your network, display and sound settings whenever you want, again all done for you automatically.


A few common tasks possible with SmartLock:

- Turns your lock screen off when you get home.
- Locks your phone when you walk out the door.
- Puts your phone on vibrate when you get to work.
- Disables your WiFi when travelling to save battery.


SmartLock uses the two basic concepts of Profiles and Triggers. 

Profiles contain a a list of settings that you can be applied to your device. They can be configured to do anything you want. 

Triggers will apply Profiles based on certain events. For example your 'Home' Profile can be applied when you get within 10m of your house.
